# An example of meta tags

This is just a basic file with examples and descriptions of the different meta tags you can use.

This example does not include every meta tag available - there are some wild ones out there! This repo gives you an example of the basic (and not-so-basic) meta tags that you can use to help make your projects shine - both on your website, and on social media!
